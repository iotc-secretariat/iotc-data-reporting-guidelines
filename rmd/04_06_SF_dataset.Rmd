#### Contents

Measurements of individual length/weight of fish for the IOTC species, common sharks, and other bycatch species
 
Individual sizes by fishery, 5Â° grid area and month strata.

Sampling coverage shall be set to at least one fish measured by ton caught, by species and type of fishery, with samples being representative of all the periods and areas fished. 

Lower and higher size class values
No.samples
No. fish

For each stratum, the data coverage -- i.e., the percentage (%) of catch/effort sampled -- derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates. 

The use of callipers or measuring boards is recommended while tape measures 
lower-jaw fork length for billfish and upper-jaw fork length (UJ) for all other 
standard length for other bycatch species?
rays: mantle length

Size intervals of 1 cm or 1 kg are recommended for fish measured in fork length or live weight, respectively.

Documents covering sampling and raising procedures shall also be provided, by species and type of fishery.
