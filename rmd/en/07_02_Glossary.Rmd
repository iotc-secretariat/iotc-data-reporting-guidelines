#### Artisanal fishery {#artisanalfishery}

Traditional fishery that involves fishing households (as opposed to commercial companies), using relatively small amounts of capital and energy, relatively small fishing vessels (if any), making short fishing trips close to shore, mainly for local consumption. In practice, definition varies between countries, e.g., from gleaning or a one-man canoe in poor developing countries, to more than 20 m trawlers, seiners, or longliners in developed ones. Artisanal fisheries can be subsistence or commercial fisheries, providing for local consumption or export. They are sometimes referred to as small-scale fisheries ([FAO 2005](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ae76ef51-be20-5e71-aec5-b469e5e0a673)).

#### Artisanal fishery (IOTC) {#iotcartisanalfishery}

The Indian Ocean (defined for the purpose of the IOTC Agreement as being FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57), and adjacent seas, north of the Antarctic Convergence, insofar as it is necessary to cover such seas for the purpose of conserving and managing stocks that migrate into or out of the Indian Ocean. In 1999, the Commission extended the western boundary of the IOTC statistical area from 30ºE to 20ºE, thus eliminating the gap in between the areas covered by the IOTC and ICCAT ([FAO Fisheries Geonetwork Platform](https://www.fao.org/fishery/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/fao-rfb-map-iotc)).

A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end.  Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. They can be laid on the bottom or suspended horizontally at a predetermined depth with the help of surface floats. The main lines can be as long as 150 km and have several thousand hooks ([FAO fishery glossary](https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/)).

#### Pole-and-line fishing {#poleandlinefishing}

A fishing technique in which surface schooling fish are attracted to the vessel and driven into very active feeding behaviour by throwing live or dead bait into the water and spraying water onto the sea surface to simulate the escape behaviour of small preys. The fish lured with a line and a hook attached to a pole and pulled off the water by manual or powered devices ([FAO fishery glossary](https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/)). 

### R {#R}

### S {#S}

#### Semi-industrial fishery {#semiindustrialfishery}

These activities are aimed at the financial benefit of the companies or organisations operating the fishing vessels, processing plants, and transport facilities ([Thermes et al. 2023](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/publications/278529)).

From a socio-economic perspective, small-scale fisheries can be broadly categorised as a dynamic and evolving sector employing labour intensive harvesting, processing and distribution technologies to exploit marine and inland water fishery resources. The activities of this sub-sector, conducted full-time or part-time, or just seasonally, are often targeted on supplying fish and fishery products to local and domestic markets, and for subsistence consumption ([FAO 2004](https://www.fao.org/3/y5245e/y5245e00.htm)).

#### Tonnage {#tonnage}

A measure of the size or capacity of a ship, representing a dimensionless function of volume which is defined by internationally agreed formulae ([Thermes et al. 2023](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/publications/278529)).

#### Trolling line {#trollingline}

Simple line, provided with natural or artificial bait and trailed near the surface or at a certain depth by a vessel. Several lines are usually towed at the same time, by using outriggers ([Nédélec and Prado 1990)](https://www.fao.org/3/t0367t/t0367t00.htm).
