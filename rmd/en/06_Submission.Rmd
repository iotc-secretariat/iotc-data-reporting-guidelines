# Data submission procedure {#SubmissionSection}

## e-MARIS platform {#emaris}

The [e-MARIS](https://emaris.iotc.org/) platform serves as the primary access point for reporting fisheries statistical data to the IOTC Secretariat. The document [e-MARIS Quick Start series for CPCs](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/compliance/emaris/Reporting_using_e-MARIS_for_CPCs.pdf) offers guidelines and technical details on connecting to the platform, monitoring IOTC requirements, and submitting the required information. For fishery statistics, all datasets must be submitted according to Requirement 5.0. Additionally, information in the relevant tables and/or sections related to specific datasets must be provided, depending on the fishery category.

## Data submission cycle {#submissioncycle}

Res. [15/02](https://www.iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1502-mandatory-statistical-reporting-requirements-iotc-contracting-parties-and) (para. 7) explicitly establishes the requirements for timely annual reporting of the core IOTC datasets, i.e., species presence in the catch, annual amounts of catches retained or discarded at sea, and monthly geo-referenced catches, efforts, and size frequencies:

_a.  Longline fleets operating in the high seas shall provide provisional data for the previous year no later than 30 June. Final data shall be submitted no later than 30 December;_

_b. All other fleets (including supply vessels) shall submit their final data for the previous year no later than 30 June;_

_c. In case where the final statistics cannot be submitted by that date, at least preliminary statistics should be provided._

Res. [19/02](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1902-procedures-fish-aggregating-devices-fads-management-plan) (para. 22) and Res. [23/01](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2301-management-anchored-fish-aggregating-devices-afads) (para. 11) follow the same deadline requirements for DFOB and AFAD-related activities, respectively, while a specific timeline of submission applies to:

i. The daily buoy position data that must be reported on a monthly basis, at least 60 days, but no longer than 90 days from the end of the month of buoy activities (Res. [19/02](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1902-procedures-fish-aggregating-devices-fads-management-plan); para. 24).

ii. The details of the new AFADs deployed within the EEZ of the CPCs that must be reported within 21 days of deployment of the AFADs (Res. [23/01](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2301-management-anchored-fish-aggregating-devices-afads); para. 8).

## Semantics {#semantics}

The [data reporting forms](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/forms/) are designed to facilitate the submission of comprehensive datasets. Except for the [forms 3BU](../forms/#Form_3BU), which contain data on [daily buoy positions](#BUdataset) and are expected to be submitted monthly, the Secretariat anticipates receiving for each fishing fleet the following with each annual submission:

- One single [form 1DR](../forms/#Form_1DR) to report data on [species presence in the catch](#DRdataset) for all gear groups
- One single [form 1IN](../forms/#Form_1IN) to report data on [interactions with ETP species](#INdataset) for all fisheries
- One single [form 1RC](../forms/#Form_1RC) to report data on [the amount of fish caught and retained](#RCdataset) for all fisheries
- One single [form 1DI](../forms/#Form_1DI) to report data on [the amount of discards](#DIdataset) for all fisheries
- One single [form 3CE](../forms/#Form_3CE) to report data on [geo-referenced catches and efforts](#CEdataset) for all fisheries
- One single [form 4SF](../forms/#Form_4SF) to report data on [geo-referenced size frequencies](#SFdataset) for all fisheries and species
- One single [form 3AA](../forms/#Form_3AA) to report data on [AFAD-related activities](#AAdataset) for all fisheries
- One single [form 3DA](../forms/#Form_3DA) to report data on [dFOB-related activities](#DAdataset) for all vessels
- One single [form 2FC](../forms/#Form_2FC) to voluntarily report data on [fishing craft statistics](#FCdataset) for all fisheries.

## Data revisions {#revisions}

If it is not possible to submit the final statistics by the specified deadline (see section [Data submission cycle](#submissioncycle))), then at least preliminary statistics should be provided. Data revisions can be performed at any time by re-submitting updated IOTC forms through [e-Maris](#emaris). To facilitate tracking changes, certain versions of the forms have been designed to allow submission of only the updated components of the dataset:

- Form [3CE-update](../forms/Form_3CE_update.html) for a given fishery;
- Form [4SF-update](../forms/Form_4SF_update.html) for a given fishery and species;
- Form [3AA-update](../forms/Form_3AA_update.html) for a given fishery;
- Form [3DA-update](../forms/Form_3DA_update.html) for a given vessel.

If revisions to historical data are made beyond a delay of two years, they must be formally reported and properly justified. These reports should be submitted using forms provided by the IOTC Secretariat and will be reviewed by the IOTC Scientific Committee. The committee will then advise the IOTC Secretariat on whether the revisions can be accepted for scientific use.
