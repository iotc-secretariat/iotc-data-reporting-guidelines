# Terminology {#TerminologySection}

Several technical terms and definitions are specific to the IOTC and key for reporting fisheries data to the Secretariat.

## Area of competence {#AreaCompetence}

The [IOTC area of competence](https://www.fao.org/fishery/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/fao-rfb-map-iotc) is defined in the article II of the [IOTC Agreement](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2012/5/25/IOTC%20Agreement.pdf) and corresponds to "the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas, north of the Antarctic Convergence, insofar as it is necessary to cover such seas for the purpose of conserving and managing stocks that migrate into or out of the Indian Ocean". For statistical purposes, the IOTC area of competence is split between two [main areas](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/admin/#IOareasMain): the Western Indian Ocean and Eastern Indian Ocean (Fig. \@ref(fig:AreaOfCompetence)).

```

## Species of interest

The 16 species and stocks managed by the IOTC – hereinafter referred as the IOTC species – are defined in the article III of the [IOTC Agreement](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2012/5/25/IOTC%20Agreement.pdf), where the term stocks means the populations of such species which are located in the IOTC area of competence or migrate into or out of the area. It is important to note that the distribution of the stock of southern bluefin tuna (_Thunnus maccoyii_) extends over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and its actual management is under the responsibility of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna ([CCSBT](https://www.ccsbt.org/])). For this species, the data reporting obligations defined for the IOTC species apply to the Indian Ocean component of the stock.

```{r PrimarySpecies, fig.cap = ""}
dtfunction(PRIMARY_SPECIES) %>% formatStyle(columns = c("SPECIES_SCIENTIFIC"), fontStyle = "italic")
```

In addition, the IOTC identified a list of species, mostly composed of commonly caught elamsobranch species, for which data reporting obligations apply as for the IOTC species. The Annex 2 of Res. [15/01](https://www.iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1501-recording-catch-and-effort-data-fishing-vessels-iotc-area-competence) provides this list of species and species groups by gear group and was further complemented for all manta rays through Res. [19/03](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1903-conservation-mobulid-rays-caught-association-fisheries-iotc-area-competence).

```{r OtherSpecies, fig.cap = ""}
dtfunction(OTHER_SPECIES) %>% formatStyle(columns = c("SPECIES_SCIENTIFIC"), fontStyle = "italic")
```

Res. [15/01](https://www.iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1501-recording-catch-and-effort-data-fishing-vessels-iotc-area-competence) further includes groups of Endangered, Threatened, and Protected (ETP) species that may interact with IOTC fisheries and for which data collection and reporting has been defined through specific CMMs: turtles (Res. [12/04](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1204-conservation-marine-turtles)), whale sharks (Res. [13/05](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1305-conservation-whale-sharks-rhincodon-typus)), cetaceans (Res. [23/06](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2306-conservation-cetaceans)), and seabirds (Res. [23/07](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2307-reducing-incidental-bycatch-seabirds-longline-fisheries)).

```{r ETPSpecies, fig.cap = ""}
dtfunction(ETP_SPECIES) %>% formatStyle(columns = c("SPECIES_SCIENTIFIC"), fontStyle = "italic")
```

Finally and while optional, the reporting of statistics for all other bycatch species is encouraged to monitor the ecosystem effects of fishing, especially when the catches of these species represent a significant proportion of the total catches of the fishery concerned.

## Fishing fleet {#fishingfleet}

A fishing fleet is a group of fishing vessels that may operate in the [IOTC area of competence](#AreaCompetence) and whose fishing operations and catches of tuna and tuna-like species are under the responsibility of a political entity or sub-entity recognized by the IOTC. The fishing fleet is derived from the combination of the flag state and reporting entity (see section on [Reporting metadata](#MetadataSection)). In most cases, the fishing fleet corresponds to the flag state but some differences stem from: (i) when the CPC is composed of multiple entities (i.e., European Union (EUR) and China (CHN)), (ii) the cases of France Overseas Territories (FRAT) and British Indian Overseas Territories (GBRT), and (iii) the existence of estimates of unreported catches not included elsewhere (e.g., NEI.PS) that need to be accounted for in the IOTC process.

## Fisheries

The IOTC fishery definition combines concepts from the fishing effort domain (fishing gear, fishing ground and fishing mode) with concepts from the catch domain (target species) and in doing so can accurately describe the fishing practices of groups of vessels and be used to characterise sub-units within a fishery. 
With the IOTC Fisheries Identification Wizard, fisheries can be identified on the basis of (i) purpose of the fishery, (ii) area of operation, (iii) length overall category, (iv) gear category, (v) gear used to catch the fish, (vi) specific configuration of the gear used to catch the fish, (vii) fishing mode, and (viii) target species.
