## Species presence in the catch {#DR}

#### Description

Matrix of presence of species in the retained catches or discards of each fishing fleet by gear group (hooks and lines, pole-and-lines, longlines, purse seines, gillnets, and other gears) broken down by broad fishery category (coastal or industrial).

#### CMMs

Res. 18/07

#### Source

Logbooks, landings, observations at sea

#### Contents

Matrix table with species in rows and gear groups in columns. For each species/gear combination, the cell must be filled with either a value of 'one' (1) to indicate positive catch or a value of 'zero' (0) to indicate no catch (zero landings + zero discards). 

#### Scope

Data must be reported for the IOTC IOTC species, most commonly caught elasmobranch species, and other bycatch species, i.e., shortbill spearfish, other sharks, and other bony fishes.

#### Metadata

Focal point full name, focal point email, organisation name, organisation email (optional), finalisation date, submission date, reporting year, reporting entity, and flag state.

#### Dimensions

[Species](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/biological/#allSpecies) and [gear group](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/fisheries/#gearGroups).

#### Checks

The list of species reported in the dataset must be consistent with the species reported in the retained catch or discard datasets.

#### Form

1 DR[template](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/forms/Form-1DR.xlsx).
