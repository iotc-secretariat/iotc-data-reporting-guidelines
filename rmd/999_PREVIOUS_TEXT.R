The timely and accurate submission of fisheries statistics to the IOTC is a core task for all CPCs, as the information provided is eventually used for purposes such as support the work of the Scientific Committee and its subsidiary bodies, assess the status of compliance with respect to mandatory reporting requirements, and determining annual contributions for members.

This updated guideline document relates to the new sets of data reporting forms, which are to be used as mandatory format to report fisheries statistics to the IOTC Secretariat.

The type of statistical data to be submitted depends on currently standing IOTC CMMS (Table. 1) and varies with the fisheries and the target and bycatch species these interact with (Fig.1).

<!-- Datasets are mandatory for reporting for the fisheries that are actively operating in the Indian Ocean for a given CPC and requested for the 16 IOTC species, sharks and raysâ€™ species of relevance to the IOTC and endangered, threatened, and protected species (ETP). Fishing craft and fish price datasets submission remains voluntary.  -->
