# Online data validation

Online data validators are designed to allow users to self-assess the quality of their data by checking that all mandatory elements have been included and that all reference codes have been used correctly.
Each form must be uploaded to the correspondent validator link when completed. This will provide an overview of the analysis carried out on the content.

The result will be a list of 'validation messages', ranging from summary information messages to increasing levels of identified issues messages: 
INFO messages are for information only, and include mainly a summary of the processed info

WARN message indicates something that will not prevent the form to be processed, although its content are less than optimal (e.g., provision of species / gear aggregates)

ERROR message indicates something that can be easily fixed by correcting codes, changing values, or providing missing information

FATAL message indicates something that will prevent reading the content of the file, e.g. wrong type of file uploaded, presence of empty rows / columns, or no fleet identified for the provided reporting entity / vessel flag.
