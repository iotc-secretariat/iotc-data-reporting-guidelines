## Geo-referenced catches and efforts {#CEdataset}

#### Description

Estimates of catches by fishing fleet, fishery, species and of fishing efforts by fishing fleet, fishery for spatio-temporal strata that vary according to the main IOTC fishery categories (Table 1). Catch data must be reported for the IOTC species as well as for the most commonly caught elasmobranch species established for each gear group (i.e., longlines, purse seines, gillnets, and pole-and-lines) in Annex II of Res. 15/01. This Annex also lists the taxa for which the reporting can be done on a voluntary basis (“Optional species to be reported”). The spatial and temporal resolutions, catch units, and level of extrapolation vary according to the fishery category (Table 1). Effort units should be consistent with the recording requirements established in Res. 15/01.

The data must be extrapolated to the total national monthly catches for each fishery in the case of longline and surface fisheries. The data must be accompanied by documents describing the extrapolation procedures (including raising factors corresponding to the logbook coverage) and submitted routinely.
