#### Contents

When present, information on buoy identifier, knowledge of the buoy position, and type of activity conducted on the buoy. For each DFOB, information on materials (i.e., presence of plastic or metal), dimensions (i.e., length, width, and height), and presence of mesh with value of mesh size for both the surface (i.e., raft) and subsurface (i.e., tail) components. Finally, species-specific estimates of catches retained and discarded in numbers or live weight equivalent for the IOTC species, common sharks, and other bycatch species.
