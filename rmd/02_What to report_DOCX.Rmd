Resolutions 15/01 and 15/02 set the standards in terms of what operational data should be collected at national level and how this has to be aggregated and reported to the IOTC Secretariat.

The spatial-temporal stratification depends of the dataset (Table 1), although strata generally include CPC / fleet, year, fishery, and species. Some datasets are further stratified by quarter and Indian Ocean major area (e.g., annual retained catches and annual discards) while other are stratified by month and by Indian Ocean statistical regular grids (e.g., catch-and-effort, FAD interactions, and size-frequency data).

The main data elements to be collected and included within each dataset are dictated by currently standing IOTC Resolutions (15/02 and others,  Fig. 1), and described as following:


Fisheries

Fisheries definition combines concepts from the fishing effort domain (fishing gear, fishing ground, and fishing mode) with concepts from the catches’ domain (target species) and that by doing so it can accurately describe fishing practices for groups of vessels and be used to characterize sub-units within a fishery. 
The IOTC fisheries identification wizard is an interactive tool with the purpose of helping IOTC CPCs in the identification and categorization of their fisheries.

Therefore the definition of fishery F in the IOTC are function of (i)Purpose of the fishery, (ii) Area of operation, (iii) category of length overall, (iv) gear category, (v) gear used to catch the fish, (vi) specific configuration of the gear used to catch the fish, (vi) fishing mode, and (viii) target species.


(i) purpose of the fishery:
	recreational, i.e., the fish is caught for recreational purposes only
	subsistence, i.e., the fish is exclusively consumed by the fishermen and their households
	commercial, i.e., the fish is sold at the landing site or at a market, exported, or sold to processing / canning factories
	scientific, i.e., the fishery only operates to collect scientific information or support the training of scientists and fishermen
	
(ii) area of operation of the vessels engaged in the fishery: 
	EEZ, i.e., vessels operate exclusively within areas under national jurisdiction of their flag state (territorial sea, contiguous zone as well as EEZ waters)
	EEZ and ABNJ, i.e., vessels operate in areas under national jurisdiction as well as in areas beyond national jurisdiction of their flag state (i.e., high seas or areas under national jurisdiction of other coastal states)
	ABNJ, i.e., vessels operate exclusively in areas beyond national jurisdiction of their flag state (i.e., high seas or areas under national jurisdiction of other coastal states)
	
(iii) category of length overall (LoA) of the vessels engaged in the fishery:
	LoA < 15 m
	15 m ≤ LoA < 24 m
	LoA ≥ 24 m

(iv) gear category; mapped on the latest ISSCFG gear groups:
	Purse seines, a subset of ISSCFG 01 (surrounding nets) that includes purse seines (01.1) and ringnets, i.e., surrounding nets without purse seines (01.2)
	Gillnets, a subset of ISSCFG 07 (gillnets and encircling nets) that includes set gillnets (07.1), drift gillnets (07.2) and encircling gillnets (07.3)
	Hooks and lines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that includes manual (09.1) and mechanized handlines (09.2), vertical lines (09.4) and trolling lines (09.5)
	Longlines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that  includes set longlines (09.31), drifting longlines (09.32) and longlines (nei) (09.39)
	Pole-and-lines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that includes manual (09.1) and mechanized pole-and-lines (09.2)
	Other, a subset of ISSCFG 02 (seine nets), 03 (trawls), 05 (lift nets), 07 (falling gear), 08 (traps), and 10 (miscellaneous gear)
	
(v) gear used to catch the fish; mapped on the latest ISSCFG gear codes, and more specifically on those belonging to the selected gear category GC

(vi)the specific configuration of the gear used to catch the fish (optional); chosen from an ad hoc classification whose possible values are determined by the specific gear G selected among those available for the gear category GC

(vii) fishing mode (optional); chosen from an ad hoc classification whose possible values are determined by the specific gear G selected among those available for the gear category GC

(viii) target species (optional), i.e., the species that most accurately represent(s) the target of the fishery; chosen from an ad hoc classification:
	neritic tunas and seerfish
	tropical tunas
	temperate tunas
	temperate and tropical tunas
	marlins and sailfish
	tunas NEI
	sharks
	albacore tuna
	southern bluefin tuna
	swordfish
	swordfish and albacore tuna
	yellowfin and albacore
	non-IOTC species
