redefine fisheries concept

concepts from the fishing effort domain (fishing gear, fishing ground, and fishing mode) with concepts from the catches’ domain (target species) and that by doing so it can accurately describe fishing practices for groups of vessels and be used to characterize sub-units within a fishery.

definition of fishery F in the IOTC:
	F = f(P,A,L,GC,G,C,M,T)
Where:
P = purpose of the fishery; can be one among:
	recreational, i.e., the fish is caught for recreational purposes only
	subsistence, i.e., the fish is exclusively consumed by the fishermen and their households
	commercial, i.e., the fish is sold at the landing site or at a market, exported, or sold to processing / canning factories
	scientific, i.e., the fishery only operates to collect scientific information or support the training of scientists and fishermen
A = area of operation of the vessels engaged in the fishery; can be one among: 
	EEZ, i.e., vessels operate exclusively within areas under national jurisdiction of their flag state (territorial sea, contiguous zone as well as EEZ waters)
	EEZ and ABNJ, i.e., vessels operate in areas under national jurisdiction as well as in areas beyond national jurisdiction of their flag state (i.e., high seas or areas under national jurisdiction of other coastal states)
	ABNJ, i.e., vessels operate exclusively in areas beyond national jurisdiction of their flag state (i.e., high seas or areas under national jurisdiction of other coastal states)
L = category of length overall (LoA) of the vessels engaged in the fishery; can be one among:
	LoA < 15 m
	15 m ≤ LoA < 24 m
	LoA ≥ 24 m
GC = gear category; mapped on the latest ISSCFG gear groups, can be one among:
	Purse seines, a subset of ISSCFG 01 (surrounding nets) that includes purse seines (01.1) and ringnets, i.e., surrounding nets without purse seines (01.2)
	Gillnets, a subset of ISSCFG 07 (gillnets and encircling nets) that includes set gillnets (07.1), drift gillnets (07.2) and encircling gillnets (07.3)
	Hooks and lines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that includes manual (09.1) and mechanized handlines (09.2), vertical lines (09.4) and trolling lines (09.5)
	Longlines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that  includes set longlines (09.31), drifting longlines (09.32) and longlines (nei) (09.39)
	Pole-and-lines, a subset of ISSCFG 09 (hooks and lines) that includes manual (09.1) and mechanized pole-and-lines (09.2)
	Other, a subset of ISSCFG 02 (seine nets), 03 (trawls), 05 (lift nets), 07 (falling gear), 08 (traps), and 10 (miscellaneous gear)
G = gear used to catch the fish; mapped on the latest ISSCFG gear codes, and more specifically on those belonging to the selected gear category GC
C = the specific configuration of the gear used to catch the fish (optional); chosen from an ad hoc classification whose possible values are determined by the specific gear G selected among those available for the gear category GC
M = fishing mode (optional); chosen from an ad hoc classification whose possible values are determined by the specific gear G selected among those available for the gear category GC
T = target species (optional), i.e., the species that most accurately represent(s) the target of the fishery; chosen from an ad hoc classification, can be one among:
	neritic tunas and seerfish
	tropical tunas
	temperate tunas
	temperate and tropical tunas
	marlins and sailfish
	tunas NEI
	sharks
	albacore tuna
	southern bluefin tuna
	swordfish
	swordfish and albacore tuna
	yellowfin and albacore
	non-IOTC species
The purpose of the fishery, which is not considered by the current IOTC classification, is now actively used to determine the fishery and its categorization.


the type of fishery derives from the combination of a) purpose, b) characteristics of the participating vessels, and c) their area of operation (to remain consistent with the RAV requirements) and introduces a more fine-grained characterization (Table 2) 


Table XXX: proposed definitions of IOTC fishery types by fishery purpose, vessel size, and area of operation. EEZ = Exclusive Economic Zone. AFVs = Authorised Fishing Vessels. * indicates an implicit categorization

input IOTC fishery types by fishery purpose 

More formally, and in analogy to what proposed for the definition of fishery, a fishery type Y is defined as:
	 Y=f(P,A,L)
Where:
P = purpose of the fishery
A = area of operation of the vessels engaged in the fishery
L = category of length overall (in meters) of the vessels engaged in the fishery
Therefore, by combining (1) and (2) we can give the following, more compact definition of fishery as:
	F=f(Y,GC,G,C,M,T)
